This project is specifically crafted to work on VGG-19{Visual Geometry Group-19} Architecture using a Celeibrity dataset from Kaggle , the main intention of the project is to classify the images based on the labels, The VGG-19 Model is trained on 80% of the data and tested on rest of the 20% data ,I also integrated Gradio for lightweight interface for testing and deployment of the output 

To increase the accuracy of my model I have used some interesting and mind boggling concepts like inception and Image Augementation , which gives  me an  accuracy of 79.95% which is quite impressive given the small size dataset. I have also used Callbacks to Retrive the best weights of the Model
